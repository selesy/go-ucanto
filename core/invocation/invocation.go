// Invocation represents a UCAN that can be presented to a service provider to
// invoke or "exercise" a Capability. You can think of invocations as a
// serialized function call, where the ability or `can` portion of the
// Capability acts as the function name, and the resource (`with`) and caveats
// (`nb`) of the capability act as function arguments.
//
// Most invocations will require valid proofs, which consist of a chain of
// Delegations. The service provider will inspect the proofs to verify that the
// invocation has sufficient privileges to execute.
